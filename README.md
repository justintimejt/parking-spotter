# Parking Spotter

Parking Spotter is a web application designed to help users quickly identify available parking spots in a parking lot using a computer vision model. The app leverages a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model trained with OpenCV and NumPy to analyze images of parking lots. Users can upload or drag-and-drop an image of a parking lot, and the app will display the availability of parking spots, confidence scores, and an analyzed image with visual indicators.

Whether you're managing a parking lot or just looking for a spot, Parking Spotter makes it easy to assess parking availability with just a photo!

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Image Input**: Users upload or drag-and-drop an image of a parking lot into the app.
2. **Model Processing**: The image is sent to the backend, where the YOLO model processes it to detect parking spots.
3. **Analysis**: The model identifies available and occupied spots, calculates confidence scores, and generates an overall parking availability score.
4. **Output**: The analyzed image is displayed with visual indicators, and the results (available spots, confidence scores, and availability score) are shown to the user.
